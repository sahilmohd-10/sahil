            I am <strong>Mohd Sahil</strong> and I am the Owner of my website.This is a Demo of how a website is look like.Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn’t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough’…

            As I recall one of the motivational quotes of Richard Feynman, I reflect upon the tremendous potential that the field of nanotechnology holds for me. I believe my academic goals to be a by-product of my exposure to electrical engineering. Capitalizing on this natural fascination and acquiring knowledge, I am all set to embrace a Master’s program in Engineering, specializing in Nanotechnology. For me, it is imperative to develop my research skills, focusing on domains like 2D nanostructures, plasmonic waveguides and optical trapping. Well, I would acknowledge this passion as an outgrowth of my curiosity in natural science, which was never a part of my academic courses.
            
            Reflecting upon my high-school days, I spent a significant time exploring physics and mathematics beyond my textbooks. During this time, I was intrigued over the MIT Open Course Ware, which I came across on the internet. Electromagnetics appealed to me with its elegance, along with its non-intuitive and evasive theories. My appetite for clearing these concepts compelled me to watch experimental demonstrations. I also came across ‘A student’s guide to Maxwell’s equations’ online, and it appeared to be my strength. In two months, I got the opportunity to mentor some of the brightest minds of India at an inter-school seminar.
            
            Even after I ascended college, it took me a couple of years to discover my fascination with solid-state devices and photonics. Out of curiosity, I took on advanced programs on semiconductor physics. Eventually, my interest in nanotechnology started growing acute, and I commenced with my formal research in nanophotonics. I found this to be a unique domain, where most of the areas of my interests overlapped. Knowing that nanotechnology holds the secret for research on the next-gen device engineering and swift computing, I decided to specialize in this discipline.
            
            As a part of my undergraduate thesis, I developed SPCE (surface plasmon coupled emission) sensors. During this time, I explored several means to enhance the coupling between surface plasmon polariton and the fluorescence emission to enhance the efficiency of fluorescence microscopy to collect signals. Rather than deploying a single film of silver, opted for Ag-GaAs-Ag stack on a prism of glass, matching index. In the process, I succeeded in enhancing both the SPCE intensity and excitation field. The reason I designed the spacer layer on the upper film of silver was that, in typical SPCE studies, the glass spacers did not contribute to the amplification of signals. Besides, I adopted several combinations involving 2D materials, like molybdenum and graphene disulfide, one-dimensional materials like CNT (carbon nanotube) and fullerene, with zero dimension due to their individual properties while interacting with molecules of fluorophore. This significantly increased the SPCE. I published the results of this paper in a journal paper, after it was reviewed by a peer.
            
            My internship at Adnano Technologies for five months bestowed me with a gratifying experience. In this company, I worked on LSPR (localized surface plasmon resonance) for SMD (single molecule detection). This involved confining the evanescent field in a small volume. I introduced a hole n the thin film of silver, as a result of which LSPR was generated. Besides, I recorded an ~8-fold enhancement in the field of excitation. However, the propagation length and penetration depth were small indeed to generate a small excitation volume.
            
            Being an avid reader, I am familiar with the transmission of quasi-TEM microwave signals and the use of plasmonic structures in CPW. These adoptions can usher many advantages over the present technology. Particularly, it would lead to lower consumption of data, high bandwidth rate and reduced layers. I look forward to research on all these fields, along with the scope of chip-to-chip deployment. This would result in reduced loss of propagation and cross talk, without compromising with the SNR.
            
            Presently, I look forward to study the Master’s program at your esteemed university and earn a higher degree, and eventually go for a PhD. Evolving as a seasoned professional, I would be able to contribute to advanced researches in the field of electrical engineering. In the process, I would also be able to serve my country, India, in terms of evolving technologies. A positive growth is already taking place back in the laboratories of my homeland. I look forward to complement my interests and professional goals with adequate formal education from your institution. Considering the sound academic infrastructure and progressive learning environment at your college, I look forward to enroll myself for the specified program. On acquiring the advanced knowledge, I would gladly propel myself closer to my professional goals.

            I am <strong>Abdul Karim</strong> and I am the guider of this website.When I graduated, I realized how severely my nation lacks in providing opportunities to fresh grads. Smacked with the inability to get a good-paying job, ambitious souls go abroad to taste success. As I like to term it, this brain drain needs to be addressed. Instead of pointing fingers at the incompetent government, we must take it upon ourselves to make a better future. The fastest way to address unemployment is by optimizing the manufacturing industry. I want to upgrade industrial systems and bring them on par with international standards, thus making us one of the world’s most efficient industries.The structure of the oral region has always fascinated me, considering its overall impact on facial construction. Considering that the human face enjoys utmost exposure, as compared to other parts of the body, my choice to become a dentist was a natural outcome of my instinct. I was 15 when I read ‘The Smile Stealers’. It was then that the history of dentistry appealed to my intellect. Nurturing this innocent interest with care, here I stand today, ready to embrace a dynamic career in dentistry. A person’s appearance and image largely rest on the way he/she talks, smiles and presents incidents. Given that a significant section of people across the globe experience difficulties due to injury in their oral region, a logical choice for me would be to put on the mask of a dentist.

            In an effort to gain a better insight into the area of my interest, I capitalized on my last summer internship. Integrating myself into several dentistry settings, I gained first-hand knowledge for four weeks. Thoroughly enjoying the fresh knowledge-acquisition process, I worked on orthodontics and implants. Most importantly, I realized that dentists need to go beyond their core skills while establishing a compassionate association with their patients. Besides, I talked to experienced dentists to learn how frustrating and stressful certain patients and cases can be. All these experiences strengthened my desire to be a part of the dentistry world and take care of patients who are suffering.
            
            Besides, I enhanced my foundational knowledge in dentistry, undertaking a job at a local clinic in Mumbai, India. This was an invaluable learning experience for me. During this phase, I came to realize the value that soft and hard skills in dentistry hold for the professionals. In particular, I carried out dental drills, which helped me gain manual dexterity. Apart from this, I was fascinated with the processes like laser frenectomy and other procedures that dentists carried out on the gums. This mechanism enabled the patient to gain normal movement of the lower lip, which previously got strained from the gum. This was the first time I saw how a CO2 laser works practically. I realized the depth of dentistry, as the professional used a specific dye and killed the bacteria around the oral region. Most importantly, the patient enjoyed a joyous experience, and I look forward to bestowing such gratifying feelings to my patients in the coming years.
            
            I also noticed how the dentists developed a rapport with the patients at the outset, so that they felt at ease. It was interesting for me to study the different social elements in the life of each patient. However, the end goal of the dentists was to establish the rapport. Eventually, I realized that communication and interpersonal skills hold the secret for success for reputed dentists.
            
            Apart from being consistent in my academics, I have demonstrated my competence in trekking, playing saxophone and flute. In the summer of 2016, I embarked on an expedition to Nepal, climbing the highest peak in the world. During this expedition, I combated both mental and physical challenges. My energetic character keeps me active. In several programs and assemblies, I have played the flute and the saxophone. I also love interacting with people, as it enhances my confidence and communication skills. Rather than playing solo, I prefer playing these instruments in small orchestras. This is where every musician works together, complementing each other’s efforts. The cohesive efforts result in a mellifluous symphony, the secret of which lies in teamwork.
            
            I have been a fervent learner all these years and would like to be a part of the sophisticated academic environment at your institute. Aligning my passion and professional goals, I hereby commit myself to the dentistry profession. A berth in your revered institution would propel me closer to my professional goals. I look forward to integrating myself into the progressive student community at your university.

            I am <strong>Asif Siddique</strong> an I am the co-guider of this website.I believe that I have been a lucky guy. Although I do not hail from a wealthy family, my parents made substantial sacrifices to educate me. Eventually, I enjoyed some things that certain kids cannot even dream of: access to quality education, a safe home to live, and most importantly, the means to transform my potential to skills. I feel an innate urge to give back to my parents, and the society at large where I grew up all these years. Channelizing my diligence and hard work, I wish to establish myself as a mechanical engineer. Having completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Delhi Technical University, India, I look forward to complement my existing knowledge with industry-oriented skills.

            I wish to specialize in the much contextual domain of energy research with transportation applications. Considering the emergency to incorporate sustainable development, I feel it to be imperative to carry out research on the cell technology or biofuel. In fact, I visualize the importance of biofuels from two different perspective. Firstly, the urgency to mitigate carbon footprint from the environment compelled me to think of a research subject, which would ultimately benefit our present and subsequent generations. Moreover, the instability of oil prices due to geopolitical aspects make it necessary to come up with a cheaper alternative for the conventional options. Particularly, thermochemical processes of converting biomass like gasification and pyrolysis interest me significantly. These mechanisms carry immense potential in producing biofuels of the second generation. Given that these processes do not disrupt prices or the food supply, it is imperative to explore such possibilities. In this context, I would like to carry out a research balancing numerical simulation and experimental investigation to obtain a better understanding of mass transport and intra-particle heat present in these conversions. Through my research, I would like to develop kinetic models defining biofuel combustion. I am also keen to explore the catalyst design principles and reaction mechanisms influencing energy efficiency under low-temperature conditions. I believe that my efforts would pave the way for large-scale commercialization of electrical vehicles.
            
            Stanford University happens to be the right institution for me to study, considering the technological sophistication. Its legacy remains unmatched, with fervent contributions to scientific advancements. It would be a gratifying experience for me to integrate myself into this progressive academic environment. Besides, the Department of Mechanical Engineering has got seasoned faculty, specializing in energy research. Personally, I have scanned gone through their academic research, and identified some of the professors I would like to be mentored by. Besides, I have contacted Professor Reginald Mitchell, expressing my intention to research in the area of his interest: developing fuel cells that run on biomass. I also had a conversation with Professor Hai Wang, as his projects on nano analytics, combustion and nanostructures for supercapacitors interested me. I know that not all these aspects share a direct connection to the area of my interest, fuel cell technology or biofuel. However, I would like to capitalize on these learning opportunities and channelize my energies towards my research area.
            
            At the graduation level, I will get the opportunity to meet new aspirants from different cultures across the globe. This will foster my growth as an independent person. I am aware of the necessary efforts and responsibilities to shoulder at the graduate level. With my orientation and experiences complementing my professional goals, I am determined and ready to shoulder the fresh challenges.
